## Description

The Order Block Finder is a software designed to analyze past performance and predict market movements in the Forex market. It provides traders with valuable insights and helps them make informed trading decisions.

## How It Works

The program consists of the following main functions:

1. `MarketMovementPrediction(int timeframe)` - This function analyzes past performance based on the selected timeframe (5 or 15 minutes) and predicts the market movement. It returns the predicted market movement, where 1 represents an upward movement and -1 represents a downward movement. If an invalid timeframe is provided, it returns 0 to indicate an error.

2. `TryBeforeYouBuy()` - This function performs testing using a trade manager/visualizer/bracketing utility. It provides a risk-free way for traders to evaluate the software and displays the results of the testing.

3. `OnStart()` - This function serves as the entry point of the program. It calls the `MarketMovementPrediction` function with a 5-minute timeframe and places a buy or sell order based on the predicted market movement. If an error occurs in the prediction, it prints an error message. Additionally, it calls the `TryBeforeYouBuy` function to test the software capabilities and prints a success message upon completion.

## Usage

To use this software, you need to call the `OnStart` function. The `OnStart` function will call the `MarketMovementPrediction` function with a 5-minute timeframe and place a buy or sell order based on the predicted market movement. If an error occurs in the prediction, it will print an error message. It will also call the `TryBeforeYouBuy` function to test the software capabilities and print a success message upon completion.

Please note that this code is a sample implementation and may need to be customized or integrated into a trading platform to work effectively.
